  <h3 id="h3-1">Education Summary</h3>
  <h4 id="h4-1">I studied in PAS for three years. I learned English for 10years since I was in kindergarten. My English level now is about B1~B2. I usually have a strong leadership when working as a team. I always organize my work and do my work efficiently. My strength is more about logic subject like math. My English grammer and writings also needs to improve more. I have more creativity, but my art skills are not proficient. However, I am good at history and math skills. I also know how to use python to code and html code. I learned many design thinking skills through design thinking class in 8th grade and the club in high school. I have an experience of teaching young child English by using online video chat. My one strength is street dance, I learned dancing for 3 and almost 4 years. I am advanced dancer, but not super-advanced dancer yet. I learned many things from different aspects. Most importantly, we need passion and patient to learn different things deeply.</h4>

  <h3 id="h3">Korrnell</h3>
  <p id="p2">I studied in Korrnell since I was 5 years old. I stayed in Korrnell till 5th grade. During those 7 years, I learned a lot and understand many things. I have many friends in Korrnell, because there were 30 people in each clasa, and there were 5 to 7 classes. That was definetly many people. My friends and classmates are fun, they always many so many things to chat and play. I was class representative when I was in first grade and third grade, and I also got a "best-student-model" when I was in first grade. I loved to go to school because I liked to chat with my classmates. We also have a long break around 10am. During that break time, me and my friends would run out as fast as we can to play the seesaw and other equipments at the playground. My elementary and kindergarten life was fun, there were no pressure on academic. However, I transferred to PAS when I was in fifth grade.

  <h3 id="h3">Pacific American School</h3>
  <p id="p2">
    I came to PAS when I was in fifth grade, and I am still here now. I've been studying in PAS for 3 and almost 4 years. At first when I was still unfamiliar to the school, I was so nervous and dumbfonded. However, I've learned a lot because there is no Chinese class anymore. We need to speak English everytime, and that probably makes me become better at English. I also have many friends here in PAS. However, after we all go to high school, we have different classes. Thus, the only time we can get together and chat is lunch time. I think studying in PAS is fun but tired. Even though we end our classes at 3 pm, we still need to put a lot of efforts in our big projects and homeworks. Many of thema re time consuming, we really need to put a lot of time and strength to finish those projects. PAS is expensive and have more resources than other local schools, so I need to work even harder to make it worth!
